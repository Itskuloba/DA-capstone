Impact of Mobile Money on Financial Inclusion in Kenya

***

## Project Title
PesaPathways

***

## Project Description
Despite Kenya's remarkable progress in financial inclusion, with formal inclusion reaching 85% in 2024 and mobile money penetration at over 83% driven by platforms like M-Pesa, significant gaps persist in underserved regions and demographic groups, limiting access to formal credit and banking services. This project addresses these disparities by examining how M-Pesa's adoptionâ€”evidenced by 28.33 billion transactions valued at KShs 40.24 trillion in FY2024 impacts financial inclusion metrics across counties and demographics, identifying barriers such as rural-urban divides and socioeconomic inequalities to inform targeted policies that promote equitable economic growth and bridge the remaining financial access gap for marginalized populations.

## Problem Statement
Despite the widespread adoption of mobile money in Kenya, the relationship between its use and traditional financial inclusion metrics, such as bank account ownership and formal credit access, remains poorly understood. This project addresses the gap by examining how the adoption of M-Pesa impacts financial inclusion across different counties and demographic groups. It will identify specific regional and demographic disparities to inform targeted interventions that can help bridge the financial divide and promote equitable economic growth.
