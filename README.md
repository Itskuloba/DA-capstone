## Project Title
PesaPathways

***

## Project Description
PesaPathways examines the transformative role of mobile money platforms in advancing financial inclusion in Kenya. Drawing on data from Safaricom, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS), and the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), the analysis quantifies how mobile money adoption influences key indicators such as bank account ownership, transaction volumes, and access to formal financial services. Through data scraping, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations, the project highlights trends, correlations, and disparities, providing insights into how digital finance drives economic empowerment and reduces barriers for underserved populations.

## Problem Statement
Kenya has achieved remarkable progress in mobile money adoption, with platforms like M-Pesa serving over 32 million users and facilitating 28.33 billion transactions annually. However, the extent to which this digital revolution translates into broader financial inclusion—such as increased bank account ownership, access to credit, and utilization of formal financial services—remains underexplored, particularly across demographic groups and regions. This gap hinders effective policymaking and leaves vulnerabilities in rural and low-income communities unaddressed. The project tackles this challenge by leveraging data-driven analysis to uncover correlations, identify regional disparities, and recommend strategies that leverage mobile money to foster more inclusive financial systems and sustainable economic development.
