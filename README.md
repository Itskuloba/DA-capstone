Impact of Mobile Money on Financial Inclusion in Kenya: Data Analytics Capstone Project Proposal

***

## Project Title
Analyzing the Role of Mobile Money in Enhancing Financial Inclusion in Kenya

***

## Project Description
This capstone project investigates the impact of mobile money platforms, primarily M-Pesa, on financial inclusion in Kenya. By analyzing data from various sources, including Safaricom, the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics and the Central Bank of Kenya, the project aims to quantify the relationship between mobile money adoption and key financial inclusion metrics like bank account ownership and transaction frequency. 

***

## Problem Statement
Despite the widespread adoption of mobile money in Kenya, the relationship between its use and traditional financial inclusion metrics, such as bank account ownership and formal credit access, remains poorly understood. This project addresses the gap by examining how the adoption of M-Pesa impacts financial inclusion across different counties and demographic groups. It will identify specific regional and demographic disparities to inform targeted interventions that can help bridge the financial divide and promote equitable economic growth.

## Research Questions
1. Trend of formal financial inclusion over the years?
2. Comparison of population using banks and mobile money?
3. Financial inclusion by demographics?
4. Impact of hustler fund on financial inclusion?
5. Correlation between mobile money usage and formal financial inclusion?
6. Comparison of financial inclusion metrics across counties?
7. Usage of Financial Services and Products by Providers?
8. Traditional SACCO vs Mobile SACCO usage?
